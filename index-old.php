		<h1>Daddy Those Men Scare Me</h1>
		<p>More prosaically down to earth and utterly English in their punk rock approach, the deliriously good Daddies have been honing their Stranglers/Members/Squeeze informed crafted, indeed crafty, punk pop round these ‘ere parts since oooooh 1994, wowsers. Better than ever too, ace band.<br /><span class="emphasis">BugBear Promotions</span></p>

		<p>The glorious English punk balladry of Daddy Those Men Scare Me! I am an unadulterated fan – great songs, powerful stage presence and laugh out loud funny lyrics. People whine on about the good old days, but the good days are here and now! Support your local bands!<br /><span class="emphasis">Bobby Moore, Those Naught Lumps</span> (and yes, that is his real name)</p>
